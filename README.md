# Java ArrayIndexOutOfBoundsException
This repository demonstrates a common Java programming error: the `IndexOutOfBoundsException`. This exception occurs when you try to access an array element using an index that is outside the valid range of indices for that array.

The `bug.java` file contains code that produces this error. The `bugSolution.java` file shows how to fix the error by checking the index before accessing the array element.

This example highlights the importance of careful array index handling in Java to avoid runtime errors.
